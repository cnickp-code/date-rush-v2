The app is called Date Rush, where users can input their location, among other preferences, in a four-step process that culminates in the generation of a date! Whether you want to spice up the spontaneity in a relationship or are simply indecisive, Date Rush is the answer! Once you are happy with the date you have constructed, you can save your date and view it any time in the profile section.

Best viewed on mobile, but desktop works perfectly fine!

## Motivation

I wanted to make an app that combined multiple APIs into a single seamless experience. It was also motivated by the fact that I like to be completely spontaneous when it comes to having fun! My goal was to create an experience for the user who is either running short on time or just wants to have a fun time with their significant other, doing things that would not be in the normal flow of daily life. That is the kind of approach I take to programming as well. I jump at the chance to push myself in order to learn and grow. Life is too short not to live like that!
